My story is not a story of a HERO. It is rather very ordinary one. All ordinary stories are always get lost in the crowd. No one wants to know a life who wakes up at morning, goes to office, fights with his boss and get back to home to wake up next day. Then, You must be wondering why I still gather courage to write a ordinary story which people will refuse to read. As I was reading a marvelous book by *Mark Manson* **(The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck)** as title suggests, it provides me enough caurage to write yet another ordinary story of mine.

### YET Another Ordinary Story

#### Ordinary School Life
I happened to be a very obidient student of very prestigious school at our time, **Rama Krishna Mission Siksha Mandir Sarisha**, part of Swami Vivekananda's RKM initiatives. 12 years of disciplined routine helped me to persue my older shelf in a better way. These years were best part of in my life, I still want to go back time and live it again and again. I wouldn't mind any *Nolan's* time loop.

#### Ordinary Engineering Education
I got my formal 4 years engineering degree from a private college. (Fullstop) :)

#### 9 to 5 Job
People usually stereo type about 9 to 5 people, I do not see any bad in it. From an entreprenuer perspective, it is also not bad as you might think. People have their responsibilities, bills to pay and not everybody born with *silver spoon in their mouth*. So, this is completely okay to persue 9 to 5 and being responsible person. What is not okay is *Let your dream die*. I believe everybody atleast in his 30s, if not in 20s can persue their dream systemitically like we do **Mutual Funds** investments. You can put the word like **Systemitc Investments in Dream**. I am on my way to draft an article to discuss more about how you can perceive dream not leaving your job. Take me as an example, I have been part of very big companies in this country also in the world still even I can see ray of hopes behind the horizons.
